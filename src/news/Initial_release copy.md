After 8 months of hard work we present our second release of the Overte VR client. 

In addition to a lot of bug fixes and smaller changes, we are introducing features such as 

* body tracking support for Windows Mixed Reality 
* user interface for voxels in the Create app
* Material Data Assistant in the Create App
* Lots of improvements in the build system and debugging
  
We also removed not anymore used inventory app. 
At the moment we are working very actively on switching the scripting language to [V8](https://v8.dev/).
This will enable us to stay compatible in the future and will bring you a lot of advantages.

For more detailed changes please see the [change log](https://github.com/overte-org/overte/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
